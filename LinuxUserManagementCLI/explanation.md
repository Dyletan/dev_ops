## Explanation: How the CLI and User Management Works

### System Architecture

The User Management CLI is built on top of Linux's native user management system. It provides a user-friendly interface to perform common user management tasks without requiring direct interaction with command-line utilities like useradd, userdel, or usermod.

### Key Components:

1. Linux User Management Module (linux_user_management.py):
- Interfaces directly with the Linux system through subprocess calls.
- Provides high-level functions for user management operations.
- Acts as a bridge between the CLI and the underlying system commands.


2. CLI User Interface (user_cli_ui.py):
- Utilizes the blessed library to create an interactive terminal interface.
- Handles user input and display of user information.
- Calls appropriate functions from the Linux User Management module based on user actions.

### Interaction Flow

1. The CLI initializes and retrieves the current list of users from the system.
2. It displays this information in a paginated format.
3. User interactions (e.g., selecting a user, pressing action keys) are captured.
4. These interactions trigger calls to the Linux User Management module.
5. The module executes the necessary system commands.
6. Results are returned to the CLI, which updates the display accordingly.

### Design Decisions

1. Use of blessed Library: Chosen for its ability to create rich terminal interfaces with minimal setup. It provides an intuitive way to handle user input and manage the display.
2. Separation of Concerns: The Linux user management functionality is separated from the CLI logic. This modular approach improves maintainability and allows for easier testing and potential reuse of the user management functions.
3. Pagination: Implemented to handle large numbers of users efficiently, improving performance and usability on systems with many user accounts.
